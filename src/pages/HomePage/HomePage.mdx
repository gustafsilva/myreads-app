# HomePage

* The home page displays three book shelves, and each book is shown on the correct shelf.
* The home page displays a control that allows users to change the books on the shelf. The control must be linked to each instance of books. The functionality of moving a book to a different bookcase works correctly.
* When the browser refreshes, the page continues to display the same information.
