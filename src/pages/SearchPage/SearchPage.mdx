# SearchPage

* The search page has a search field.
* When the user types something in the search field, the books related to their search are correctly displayed on the page.
* Search results are not shown when all search input text is deleted
* Invalid searches are taken care of and past results are not shown.
* Search works properly when a book does not have a thumbnail or author. (To test this, search for "poetry" and "biography").
* The user can search with multiple words, such as "artificial intelligence".
* Search page results allow users to select "currently reading", "want to read" or "read" and put the books on the right shelf.
* Books that do not have a bookcase have the "None" mark in the pick list.
* Books already on the shelf have the markup on their respective shelf in the selection list.
* When a book is categorized on the search page and the user navigates to the main page, the book appears in the respective homepage of the home page.
